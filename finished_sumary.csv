0,How to Export Mexican Fresh Produce to the US, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/global-trade/how-to-export-mexican-fresh-produce-to-the-us/, global trade, If you are interested in exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. you must understand all U.S. requirements and regulations associated with the process including necessary documentation. Exporting food is a complicated process due to the fact that these commodities are directly related to public health and safety. Fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. must meet the same regulations as produce produced in the U.S. and products must be safe and contain no prohibited ingredients. Labeling and packaging are also critical components. Exporting is complicated – work with a broker The importance of understanding and complying with importing laws regulations and requirements cannot be overemphasized. Mexican exporters may wish to obtain guidance from private-sector experts who specialize in importing produce into the U.S.  for example licensed customs brokers (entry filer) attorneys or consultants. Customs brokers are the only persons authorized by the tariff laws of the United States to act as agents for Mexican exporters in the transaction of their customs business. Customs brokers are private individuals or firms licensed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prepare and file the necessary customs entries arrange for the payment of duties take steps to effect the release of the goods in CBP custody and otherwise represent their principals in customs matters. Overview of U.S. Agencies Involved in Importing Fruits and Vegetables into the US There are three U.S. government entities involved in the import of fruits and vegetables into the U.S.: U.S. Department of Agricultural Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) The U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determine the admissibility of various food products imported into the United States. The CBP enforces APHIS regulations at ports of entry. CBP agriculture specialists inspect shipments of imported products and ensure that the required permits and phytosanitary certificates (for plant products) accompany each shipment. USDA’s AMS enforces the federal marketing orders for fruits vegetables and specialty crops as well as compliance with import regulations including labeling requirements. Laws require specific fruit vegetable and specialty crop imports into the United States to meet the same or comparable grade size quality and maturity standards as domestic products covered by federal marketing orders. How to determine if you can export your fruit and vegetable to the U.S. APHIS makes sure that all imported agricultural products shipped to the United States from abroad meet the agency's entry requirements to exclude pests and diseases of agriculture. If you want to export fresh fruits and vegetables for consumption first check the Fruits and Vegetables Import Requirements (FAVIR) database to understand which fruits and vegetables by commodity or country are allowed. This also gives you the general requirements for their exportation to the United States such as required treatments special inspections preclearance status and/or approved arrival ports. To export foreign fruits and vegetables you must apply for an agricultural import permit from APHIS and obtain a phytosanitary certificate from the exporting country. Attached is an APHIS Factsheet: Importing Food and Agricultural Products into the United States in Spanish. Overview of FDA requirements Under provisions of U.S. law contained in the U.S. Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act importers of food products including fruits and vegetables are responsible for ensuring that the products are safe sanitary and labeled according to U.S. requirements. Exporters and/or importers of fruits and vegetables must register with FDA. All commercial food products are subject to prior notice filing with FDA. Imported fruits and vegetables are subject to FDA inspection upon arrival at U.S. ports of entry . FDA may detain shipments of products if they are found not to be in compliance with U.S. requirements. Overview of CBP requirements CBP enforces the requirements set forth from APHIS and the FDA to allow fruits and vegetables to enter the U.S. CBP will not release food shipments without proof that prior notice (PN) has been filed with FDA. Therefore it is imperative that the PN satisfied number is submitted to CBP along with the entry documents. The PN satisfied number should be annotated on the shipping documents (i.e. bill of lading or airway bill). In addition to the PN requirement once the goods arrive in the U.S. FDA may collect a sample or tell CBP to proceed with releasing the shipment. If a sample is in violation of FDA regulations you will receive a Notice of Detention from FDA. To find out the status of food that has been detained by FDA call the number referenced on the detention notice or the main number for Import Operations and Policy at (301) 443-6553. View the CBP's Guide: Importing into the United States A Guide for Commercial Importers Overview of USDA AMS Requirements It is the responsibility of the importer of record to have each imported lot (shipment) inspected for grade and quality by AMS. The importer is defined as the party responsible for clearing the goods through customs and could be the shipper the receiver or a third party such as a broker or attorney of record. As of September 1 2016 all imported fruit and vegetables subject to AMS regulation must be presented for inspection to AMS or its Federal-State partners as separate lots that correspond to each individual Customs Entry Number. View more information on USDA's AMS import requirements Other considerations for Mexican fresh produce exporters While the information presented here provides a high-level summary of agencies a Mexican exporter may need to work with there are many other details regulations and paperwork needed for compliance. It is best to work with a broker. Additionally this document notes formal regulations necessary for exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. However there may be additional requirements specific to U.S. buyers such as food safety certifications labeling or packaging. Overview of Mexican Agencies Involved in Exporting Fruits and Vegetables from Mexico If you are exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. from Mexico you must understand the Mexican agencies and regulations associated with the process. Here is a high-level summary of Mexican government agencies’ role: SENASICA SENASICA protects agriculture water and livestock resources from economic and quarantine importance pests and diseases. Additionally it regulates and promotes the application and certification of the food contamination risk reduction systems and its agri-food quality to facilitate the vegetal and animal-based domestic and international trade. SAGARPA SAGARPA promotes supporting policies to improve production make better use of the comparative advantages of the agricultural sector integrate rural environment into the rest of the economy’s productive supply chains and incite growers’ organizations collaboration within their own programs and projects. SAT SAT is responsible for applying the fiscal and customs legislation with the goal that both individuals and companies contribute to public expenses on a proportional and equitable basis inspect tax payers so they comply with tax and customs provisions; facilitate and encourage voluntary compliance and generate and provide the necessary information for the design and evaluation of the tax policy. COFEPRIS COFEPRIS establishes and implements politics programs and projects at the level of international best practice under effective coordination with the different players in the public private and social sectors to prevent and assist on sanitary risks contributing to public health. Documents required to Export Fresh Produce to the U.S. Attached is a summary guide to export fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico  including the documents required by the customs broker to export. It is valuable for any Mexican exporter or Mexican companies interested in exporting to the U.S.: 1. Required export documents for a customs broker in Mexico and the Mexican government phytosanitary requirements. 2. Required export documents for a customs broker in the U.S. and the U.S. government phytosanitary requirements. ,Exporting fruits and vegetables to the US necessitates thorough understanding and strict compliance with complex US agency regulations and is best achieved with a customs broker.,(Produce Export US)(Regulations Agencies)(Customs Brokers)
1,Europe’s economic social and environmental growth strategy, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/global-trade/the-european-green-deal-overview-and-implications-for-produce/, global trade, The European Green Deal is a Europe’s economic social and environmental growth strategy moving forward. The European Commission is committed to supporting this strategy through transformative policies and direct investment. If you do business in the EU or have European business partners this will affect your organization over the coming years. Here we bring you the basics of what the Green Deal is and start to unpack what this will mean for our industry both in Europe and around the world. Motivated by the social economic and environmental consequences of global climate change the Green Deal strives to achieve one landmark goal: to be completely carbon neutral by the year 2050. Moreover they commit to achieving this goal while at the same time both breaking the link between economic growth and resource use and ensure that all no one is left behind. This is a completely radical ambition not just paying lip service to sustainability but making it the star of the show for the largest trade block in the world. Under the Green Deal the commission has been and will continue to roll out relevant policy. The following are the identified policy areas and how they connect to our industry. Policy Areas: Biodiversity The produce industry is of course dependent on plant crops all of which are derived from naturally occurring species that have been brought into cultivation. Maintaining biodiversity on our planet provides sources for diversity in our products. Farm to Fork The produce supply chain will be directly affected by new policies that address how food moves from the field to consumers. Sustainable Agriculture Growers will need to adapt their farming practice to be in compliance. Clean Energy The exact implementation is to be determined but this policy area will likely have a more diffuse affect on the produce industry. Sustainable Industry Processing and packaging operations will be affected under this policy area as the Green Deal champions environmentally friendly production techniques and facilities. Building and Renovating Produce will be tangentially affected here as shippers warehouses and processors upgrade or build new facilities. Sustainable Mobility To achieve net carbon neutrality the Green Deal scrutinizes many sources of greenhouse gas emissions including transportation. Shippers in the produce industry will be directly affected by this policy area. Climate Action This is the direct goal of getting the EU to a point of carbon neutrality by 2050. This broad area can cover any point source of greenhouse gas emissions not directly addressed above. The EU Green Deal is revolutionary and vast in its scope.  Any single major policy shift will have a broad reaching ripple effect throughout an industry and here we are looking at multiple policy areas. Luckily we have the gift of time when it comes to the Green Deal: by unveiling the vision of this before the policies all go into effect our industry has time to anticipate and invest to succeed because of rather than in spite of these changes. We can look at the Green Deal as an opportunity to invest and make our businesses more sustainable on a level playing field. Rather than having to consider whether an investment into sustainability will make your business less competitive remember that most of your peers will have to make those same investments to maintain access to the European market. This has two effects. First eco-friendly products will become more affordable to you. We have seen this very clearly throughout history: as expensive new technology becomes widely adopted it becomes cheaper. Here the Green Deal will essentially force the adoption of new technologies to achieve sustainability goals and the cost to make your business more sustainable will decrease as a result. Second the entire industry will be investing and making changes in their businesses to meet the Green Deal policy requirements. While there is a concern that these efforts will cut into margins remember that it will do so for your competitors as well. In many ways the Green Deal reflects values that we already hold dear: access to fresh healthy food that nourishes our global population. As the EU Green Deal unfolds in a series of policy changes we are here to support our members as you navigate these changes and maximize the benefits for your businesses. The power of the EU is that the scale of this initiative will likely lead the global industry towards a greener world. As companies change how they do business and make the investments necessary to enter the European market they will inevitably become more competitive in other markets because of the higher quality of their products and higher social standards under which they do business. The EU has taken a stance and the world of fresh will follow. ,The European Green Deal is a vast EU strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 transforming business practices and creating global opportunities.,(European Green Deal)(Carbon Neutrality)(Industry Transformation)(Sustainable Practices)
2,Southeast Asia's Fresh Produce Trade, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/global-trade/southeast-asias-fresh-produce-trade/, global trade, Indonesia the Philippines and Thailand are the key fresh fruit producers in Southeast Asia. The region primarily exports fresh fruit which has increased over the last three years but overall the region remains a net fresh produce importer. This article details Southeast Asia's role in global fresh produce production and the key countries producing importing and exporting in the region. Fresh Produce Trade Southeast Asia produces approximately 7 percent share of global fresh produce quantity and production has grown 3 percent over the three-year period of 2011-2013. Indonesia the Philippines and Thailand are the key fresh fruit producers in this region. In addition to its production the region is a net fresh produce importer. Exports The region primarily exports fresh fruit — accounting for a 4 percent share of global fresh fruit export value. The Philippines Thailand and Vietnam are the leading exporters in the region. Exports are increasing. Southeastern Asia’s fresh fruit exports averaged annual increases of more than 30 percent between 2010 and 2013 outpacing the global fresh fruit export growth rate of an average 20 percent. Imports Southeast Asia is a net fresh produce importer and accounts for a 4 percent share of global fresh produce imports. Fruit imports are growing — on average 20 percent annually in the last three years. Apples other fresh fruits citrus and grapes are the top fresh fruits imported. Apple grape and mango imports are driving growth. Indonesia the Philippines and Vietnam are among leading growth markets for fresh food globally posting double digit consumption growth between 2010 and 2015. For fresh produce specifically Malaysia Indonesia Thailand and Singapore are the key import markets in Southeastern Asia. Trade ASEAN currently has six key Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with Australia China India Japan New Zealand and South Korea. And there is talk of creating a single FTA between these six countries and ASEAN a more interconnected trade deal within a trade deal (Euromonitor). In addition ASEAN is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU. ASEAN members including Brunei Malaysia Singapore and Vietnam are also currently part of negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)  the largest trade deal to be negotiated to date and will liberalize trade among economies in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions. Opportunities & Challenges for Fresh Produce in Southeast Asia Southeast Asia’s strong economic performance and forecasted growth will continue to drive development in the region. Increased urbanization and a youthful population with increasing purchasing power will fuel this growth. Although much of its current trade is concentrated in the Asia Pacific region (China Japan etc.) Southeast Asia is positioned to diversify its trade base with the impending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Trade Agreement which could broaden trade in the Pacific Rim with the Americas. The TPP will create first-time trade deals among many of the countries involved in the negotiations. Malaysia and Vietnam have had no prior trade deals with the U.S. Mexico or Peru. Reduced or eliminated tariffs are expected for the trade of agricultural products. Additionally through the ASEAN integration the goal of creating a single market of more than 600 million consumers will be realized along with their manufacturing and services industries streamline trade flowing to and from the region. Insufficient infrastructure higher unemployment among the youth and known corruption affecting many of the countries in the region could hinder foreign investment and development. Additionally the region is prone to floods which could impact infrastructure development and agricultural production.

3,Suppling Middle East’s Demand for Fresh Fruits & Vegetables, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/global-trade/who-supplies-the-middle-easts-increasing-demand-for-fresh-produce/, global trade, According to The Economist the growing populations of Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the UAE also called the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) point to increased dependence on imported food staples. Food imports are projected to grow to US$53.1 billion by 2020. Major factors driving the GCC market include growing domestic and expat population rising health consciousness among the population changing tastes and preferences and growing disposable income leading to higher consumption of nutritional foods as part of a stable diet. The United Nations’ figures reveal the population of GCC countries jumped by 18.9 percent in the last five years. In countries like Saudi Arabia the birth rate has topped 20 percent consistently in recent years. According to a report published by the Economist Intelligence Unit by 2020 the GCC population is forecast to reach 53.5m a 30 percent increase over the level in 2000. IFPA reports that consumers with changing tastes are willing to pay a premium for an assortment of produce offering freshness quality flavor safety and convenience. “Young and affluent Western food-loving consumers are driving the growth and demand for imported goods and foods in the Middle East” states an analyst from Mintel. In addition there are healthy eating efforts toward purchasing more fruits and vegetables. Falling groundwater and aquifer levels in the Arabian Peninsula limited rainfall arid climate overreliance on imports and rising soil salinity are affecting the fruits and vegetables market. The region’s dependence on desalinated water means that meeting more of its food needs through domestic production is not an option in the long term. Key import markets in the Middle East Saudi Arabia the UAE Kuwait and Egypt are the largest markets for fresh produce imports. Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for over 2 percent of global fresh produce imports and Saudi Arabia fresh produce imports are growing at a faster rate than global imports in the last five years. Top items imported Citrus and berries are sizeable categories growing in the last three years. Berries increased +8% CAGR from 2014 through 2016. Who supplies the growing import markets in the Middle East? In total the Middle East is a net fresh produce exporter. About 40 percent of the Middle East’s fresh produce imports are supplied by other Middle Eastern countries with Egypt and Turkey being the two largest suppliers. But various other countries supply the rest. The growing markets for fresh produce in Saudi Arabia UAE and Kuwait have increased supply from various countries including South Africa Europe Latin America and the Asia Pacific region including Australia and India. ,GCC nations increasingly depend on imported food staples due to population growth and limited domestic production capabilities.,(GCC Food Imports)(GCC Population Growth)(Consumption Demand Factors)(Water Scarcity Limitations)(Fresh Produce Markets)
4,2021 Fresh Produce Retail in China, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/global-trade/2021-fresh-produce-retail-in-china/, global trade, China’s fresh produce retail market is impressive not only for its present scale but also its vast untapped potential. The market value for fresh goods (fresh produce meat eggs dairy seafood) was $738 billion in 2019 of which $407 billion was for fresh produce. But viewed from a per capita perspective annual retail spending on fresh goods in 2020 was only $525. China is in the midst of a steady march from middle-income to developed country status which is spurring an unprecedented increase in the size of the middle class and a continuous upgrading of consumer consumption patterns. Under prevailing economic conditions China’s fresh produce retail market is poised for strong growth in coming years. This report is available exclusively to IFPA members. Not yet a member?

5,FSMA 204 Traceability Rules Think Tank, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/supply-chain-management/fsma-204-traceability-rules-think-tank/, food safety, Sponsored by: FDA released the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 204 Final Rule establishing additional recordkeeping requirements for persons who manufacture process pack or hold foods FDA has designated for inclusion on the Food Traceability List (FTL) . The rule went into effect on January 20 2023 and will be enforced starting on January 20 2026. The rule applies to persons who manufacture process pack or hold foods that appear on the Food Traceability List or foods that contain a listed food as an ingredient unless an exemption applies. Although the FSMA 204 Final Rule covers more than just fresh produce similar to the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI) the produce industry is leading the way on FSMA 204 Final Rule implementation for other industries to follow. The FSMA 204 Traceability Rules Think Tank explored how the FSMA 204 Final Rule regulations and implementation will be used by buyers and how IFPA can assist buyers during the implementation period. Additionally IFPA learned how to best support members from an information and advocacy perspective as IFPA communicates with FDA. It is clear the industry is at different stages of confusion regarding the rule’s expectations and requirements. Some noted there is confusion among suppliers and others between the differences between the FSMA rule and PTI best practices. Many buyers need assistance with identifying compliance expectations for their supplier base and then identifying how those expectations get conveyed to their distribution network. There is widespread agreement that there needs to be more specifics and clarity communicated on the rule with IFPA leading the way. Standardizing rules for all produce commodities Although the rule technically applies only to foods that appear on the FTL one of the most important takeaways from the Think Tank was that the industry is determined to implement one set of rules for all produce items regardless of if the commodities are on the FTL. Simply put buyers will expect companies to comply with the same set of regulations in the FSMA 204 Final Rule for all commodities. It was noted that companies may experience some pushback from supply chain partners on this expectation but it was agreed that it is crucial to have the same processes for all commodities in order to improve traceability and avoid confusion between different labeling processes for different commodities. Additionally distribution centers are not willing or able to manage multiple processes based on different commodities. Establishing minimum requirements of the rule The second major takeaway from the discussion was the need to standardize the requirements of the rule across all buyers. Many noted that there has to be absolute minimum requirements established otherwise suppliers will be burdened with too many processes. Additionally without minimum requirements retailers will all have different expectations for what data they need to capture and store from their suppliers. The Think Tank participants were very supportive of requiring every company to follow the same set of requirements posed by the rule similar to the process that was followed for the PTI Harmonized Label. Establishing a minimum set of requirements will help companies’ operations be as efficient as possible in complying with the rule. Currently some suppliers use a non PTI Harmonized Case Label and often there is multiple barcodes and even QR codes which can make it confusing for the receiver identify the traceability lot code. There must be a clear way to identify which barcode is the traceability lot code. Central to the rule’s operation a traceability lot code is a descriptor often alphanumeric used to identify a traceability lot. Traceability lot consists of a batch or lot of food that has been initially packed received by the first land-based receiver or transformed. A brand-new data requirement in the FSMA 204 Final Rule is the traceability lot code source. This is the contact information of the location where a food was packed or transformed and assigned a traceability lot. Conducting pilots for FDA Several participants expressed the need to receive increased clarity from FDA on lot traceability expectations. Fortunately there is widespread interest and willingness among the industry to work with the FDA to conduct traceability pilots. There are natural error rates in shipping product whether from missing labels broken labels or incorrect information on a pallet. Conducting pilots and collecting data will help show FDA realistic expectations for compliance namely the accuracy rate that can be reasonably expected with available methods. Otherwise companies may experience higher costs and less efficient operations by trying to reach an unrealistic lot number accuracy metric for compliance. The hope is that allowing for a margin for error will actually help speed up the identification of the source of the pathogen by removing 100% accuracy assumptions. PTI’s FSMA workgroup will include pilots so the industry may be able to demonstrate to FDA the realistic accuracy of tracking lot numbers in stores or restaurants. Instead of needing to provide just one lot number the hope is that the industry can provide a range of lot numbers from a pick slot at a given time. Several participants noted the need for a standardized template for a sortable spreadsheet to help with compliance and to get back to the source of an outbreak as quickly as possible especially with multi-state outbreaks with a lot of locations and data. The spreadsheet will be the best way to record traceability data and will inform any gaps that need to be filled for records. Ultimately once there is consensus from the industry on a workable spreadsheet data will be recorded and shared with FDA using this template. Communicating with supply chain partners A common concern voiced is the amount of time and work will be required to train sometimes hundreds of suppliers and dozens of distribution centers on the processes to follow to comply with the rule so no loads get rejected. Additionally buyers noted the challenge the rule will present working with the sometimes inadequate or insufficient data and records of their supply chain partners namely smaller distribution centers suppliers and farmers who sometimes have outdated technology and methods of keeping data. It will be imperative to make sure all partners understand the rule is not a recommendation or suggestion; it’s a requirement. This was referenced as an issue with the rollout of PTI. However this must be balanced with the need to be sensitive to suppliers to avoid adding extra work and costs. It was suggested that retail and foodservice sectors of the supply chain need to work together and communicate with suppliers and distribution centers on the expectations for complying with the rule. One idea presented was that retailers can lead knowledge transfer sessions with suppliers and other partners to ensure all expectations will be met. It is important to reach alignment from the buying community in order to properly educate the supply chain and work together with partners effectively. Specifically buyers need to agree to use the harmonized PTI label and standardized electronic Advanced Shipment Notifications (PTI ASNs) and understand what is going to be required of them and their partners in the next three years. Identifying Next Steps IFPA is already discussing standardizing expectations of the rule across different industries with FMI. Going forward it was recommended that at least one member of each company be part of PTI’s FSMA workgroup that meets every three weeks to identify everything included in the rule. The workgroup will communicate out on the expectations of the rule provide best practices for compliance and educate the industry more fully on the rule. To help companies get aligned on expectations of the rule the Think Tank participants requested IFPA provide a timeline of milestones to help them comply with the rule until it is enforced in 2026. It was recommended that IFPA serve as the point of contact to guide people on meeting certain milestones for 2023 2024 and 2025. The participants were interested in meeting again next time with a few major decision points to make heading into the meeting. ,The produce industry is striving to standardize clarify and efficiently implement the new FDA FSMA 204 food traceability rule across all commodities and supply chain partners prior to its 2026 enforcement.,(FSMA 204 Rule)(Food Traceability)(Industry Compliance)(Standardization)(Supply Chain Education)
6,Whole Genome Sequencing, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/food-safety/whole-genome-sequencing/, food safety, Is it really a big deal? Why? YES. Because FDA (and other regulators) are using it to link pathogen isolates from your food or your facility to human illness. Didn’t they have systems to do this before? How is this new? It is a newer technology that is far superior to the previous approach (pulsed field gel electrophoresis; PFGE). In a 2015 article in Scientific American David Acheson a former official at both the USDA and the FDA likened the difference to a witness in a hit and run accident. “While PFGE might identify the vehicle as a brown Toyota Corolla whole genome sequencing provides the license number and even the vehicle identification number.” Is this related to the “swab-athons” I’ve heard about where FDA or states take hundreds of environmental samples? Yes. Any time they find L. monocytogenes they are sequencing the isolate and entering it into the database to see if there is a match to illness—even if that illness occurred years ago. Additional information Whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology has rapidly evolved in recent years. It is now possible to rapidly and inexpensively sequence bacteria such as foodborne pathogens to obtain a “fingerprint”. WGS has been adopted by FDA USDA and CDC and has been used in microbial foodborne illness investigations for the last several years. Government agencies use a database called GenomeTrakr which now has over 60000 bacterial isolates from food and clinical sources. It is vital that the food industry understand the emerging technology and its application. Food Safety News reported that by using WGS FDA was able to show that a specific strain of L. monocytogenes in an ice cream production facility was resident (not transient). The company received a warning letter which stated “The evidence demonstrates that L. monocytogenes has maintained its presence within your production facility since 2015. The reoccurring presence of an identical strain of L. monocytogenes in your environment indicates a resident strain or niche harborage site present in the facility… These findings also demonstrate that your sanitation procedures have historically been inadequate to control reduce or eliminate this pathogenic organism from your facility.” Just because FDA (or USDA FSIS) finds a match between your product or facility and human illness does it prove that you are at fault? While the single piece of evidence may not be conclusive you can certainly expect the regulators to come asking questions. A poster presented at the United Fresh Produce Convention in June 2016 described a 2-year study of L. monocytogenes found in multiple packing houses. The researchers out of Dr. Trevor Suslow’s lab at UC Davis used different molecular techniques including Whole Genome Sequencing and Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) to sort and characterize the isolates. They found that “Indistinguishable and closely related pulsotypes were observed in the same packing facility on multiple sample collection dates suggesting persistence or residency of a given strain. Furthermore some L. monocytogenes isolates recovered from different facilities (geographically far apart) in different years were found to have indistinguishable or highly related PFGE pulsotypes.” More science is needed to understand how quickly different organisms evolve and the geographic distribution and persistence of “indistinguishable” pathogens. Although there is still a lot to learn about what WGS can and can’t tell us regulators are nevertheless using this technology and the impact on the fresh produce industry will continue to increase. ,Regulators employ whole genome sequencing a superior technology to precisely link foodborne pathogens from facilities to human illness impacting the food industry.,(Whole Genome Sequencing)(Food Safety Pathogens)(Regulatory Enforcement)(Listeria monocytogenes)
7,Listeria Monocytogenes, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/food-safety/listeria-monocytogenes/, food safety, Listeria Overview for General Understanding Listeria monocytogenes remains a food pathogen of priority due to both the severity of listeriosis in humans and the frequency of outbreaks caused by Lm contamination. Understanding and implementing effective preventive control strategies to reduce control and/or eliminate the risk of listeriosis in produce grown packed manufactured/processed or held is critical. What is Listeria monocytogenes (Lm or L. mono)? Lm are bacteria that cause the foodborne illness Listeriosis. People can get sick from Lm if they eat a food that is contaminated with Lm. Foods that have been associated with Lm are raw milk inadequately pasteurized milk chocolate milk cheeses (particularly soft cheeses) ice cream raw fruits and vegetables raw poultry and meats (all types) fermented raw-meat sausages hot dogs and deli meats and raw and smoked fish and other seafood. Compared to other foodborne illnesses such as Salmonella or E. coli the number of people infected with Listeria is small. However this bacterium is one of the leading causes of death from foodborne illness. Who is most at risk? Pregnant women are more susceptible to Listeria infection. While many pregnant women recover from the illness their babies do not. People with weakened immune systems are also more susceptible such as AIDS and cancer patients. The elderly are also especially vulnerable. Why is Listeria monocytogenes a concern to growers packers and fresh-cut processors? Listeria can be found in the same environments where fresh fruits and vegetables are grown. It can be found in soil water and decaying vegetation. It can also establish itself in cold wet environments which are common conditions in packing facilities. Listeria could possibly be transferred from raw fruits and vegetables from the field and introduced into packing facilities. This transient Listeria could become established in the facility if proper sanitation practices are not carried out. These bacteria that find a home in niches in the facility are often referred to as resident. This resident Listeria could multiply if conditions are favorable in the facility and then contaminate the produce by moving from facility contact surfaces onto fruits and vegetables. This cross contamination can be prevented if proper cleaning and sanitation and environmental monitoring programs are established.

8,Traceability, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/supply-chain-management/traceability/, food safety, Traceability is a business process that enables trading partners to follow products forward and backward through the supply chain. Produce Traceability Traceability is important to the produce industry for many reasons including improving food safety by being able to quickly and accurately remove potentially harmful products from the supply chain. The Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI) is an industry led initiative to achieve whole chain traceability in the produce supply chain by using common industry data standards and the electronic storage and retrieval of traceability related data. Traceability has become an issue of great importance to the produce industry due to regulatory requirements such as the U.S. Bioterrorism Act  as well as ongoing food safety issues and the need for supply chain transparency and more information on the produce we grow pack ship store process distribute and sell. The Produce Traceability Initiative was formed in 2008 by representatives from over 40 companies including growers packer/shippers marketers distributors and wholesalers food service and retail and eight trade associations to begin working on an action plan to ensure the industry has a process that will work for the entire supply chain. The Produce Traceability Initiative Steering Committee developed a traceability solution that members felt could be reasonably implemented by produce companies large and small alike across the entire supply chain and operating within the U.S. market and those exporting to the U.S. Leafy Green Traceability Pilots Reveal the Value of Sharing Extended Product Information During a Traceback Investigation On December 3 2020 a group of six industry organizations released a report outlining four months of leafy green traceability pilots with supply chain partners including growers distributors and both independent and chain retailers offering a detailed response to the request by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) for improved traceability in the food system. The three pilots conducted July through October showed that investigations into foodborne illness outbreaks could be streamlined and conducted more effectively when supply chain partners provided extended product information during tracebacks. Additionally the use of a standard template called the Produce Traceback Template to exchange pertinent product information was found to enhance the speed of tracing procedures. All of the pilots were successful in tracing the source of the affected product. Food Traceability in Legislative and Regulatory Circles While several congressional bills include traceability either as a component or as the exclusive focus including the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) which will encompass a record-keeping rule that focuses on traceability. Industry Perspective on Proposed Rule Growers fresh-cut processors distributors and retail/foodservice sectors each face unique challenges in capturing managing and linking traceability data and developed a white paper to share some of these perspectives. FDA's Product Tracing Pilot Report Released from IFT aligns with PTI A report Pilot Projects for Improving Product Tracing Along the Food Supply System Final Report required by FSMA was published for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). It provided recommendations on traceability that are consistent with the industry's Produce Traceability Initiative. The report aligns with PTI in many of its recommendations including: encouraging current industry-led initiatives not excluding commodities accepting electronic traceability data/records during product tracing investigations requiring all organizations that handle food in the supply chain to identify and maintain records of traceability related information Produce Traceability Initiative Participating Companies PTI is supported by the volunteer work of dozens of companies that hail from across the fresh produce supply chain from farm to store to table. Representatives of these companies currently serve as volunteers to PTI's Leadership Council Executive Committee working groups and/or task forces. Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC) The Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC) is a collaborative partnership including public and private stakeholders created to address the challenges and opportunities of global food traceability implementation. The Mission of the GFTC is to serve all aspects of the global food system by generating knowledge that addresses informational gaps while delivering applied research objective advice and practical expertise about food product traceability and data collaboration for private benefit and public good. PMA participates as the sole produce trade association as a founding member and advisory board member of the GFTC. This will ensure the fundamentals of the Produce Traceability Initiative will be adopted by the GFTC as the global standard for fresh produce traceability.

9,8 Steps to Consider When Creating a Technology Roadmap, https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/technology/technology-roadmap/, technology, JANUARY 16 2019 1. Look for your pain points and be willing to change. Each business is different and while we share some common pain points others may be more specific. A technology solution that meets the needs of one type of operation may be useless to another. Sometimes we get so busy running the day-to-day operations of our businesses we don’t take the time to look at the business environment around us. What are the new trends? What’s the competition doing? What do my customers want? What are my business needs? Step back examine your business and find your true pain points. The second gift you can give yourself is to be open to change. It’s human nature to be uncertain of change or to even fear it. But in this ever-competitive environment we work in chances are you are going to have to change your operations. In fact that’s really what this is about: making changes that render your operation more cost effective sustainable efficient and better suited to meet your customers’ needs. Only one certainty – if you don’t continue to evolve your business others will make those changes and you could find yourself out of business. 2. Develop awareness of technologies develop connections and engage with entrepreneurs and vendors. Find sources of information. Connect with entrepreneurs and start-ups. And don’t forget about established technology and service providers who are offering new opportunities upgraded technology products and services. Lastly engage. Trade associations and universities are always providing opportunities to engage. Go to demonstrations work with technology providers to test equipment and develop a sense of whether that technology product is a solution to your pain point. 3. Evaluate your current systems and map where you want to go. Ever stand back in your field packinghouse processing plant or distribution facility and just watch? Is what you see efficient? Do you have too many workers or too few? Does the product flow evenly or stop and start? Does the product move from one part of the operation to another to create efficiencies? Do you have equipment that can generate digital data? Can you collect and analyze that data? Can pieces of equipment communicate with each other? What measures do you currently have in place to help you identify where you might get better? Can you measure how much each step costs you? Are there cost savings there? What are the financial implications (cost of capital versus operational costs ROI opportunity to increase business threat of business loss to competition)? Are your production processes choreographed like a ballet or do they look like a crowd exiting a football stadium going every which way? You need to map your process. Identify where you should make changes to improve efficiencies quality safety. Identify the priorities and know what your timelines and resources are. 4. Check upstream and downstream. You have to think of what you are doing as a process. You want to build in efficiencies; not move your problems upstream or downstream from your new technology. Components of your process all need to work together. If one operation works faster than another then you just build up behind that step and you don’t really gain any speed efficiency or cost savings. Check upstream and downstream of where you want to make a change. You need to synchronize steps so they work together and the whole process gains speed cost savings and more consistency. You have to think of controlling and improving the whole process whatever your production process might be. 5. Adopting a new technology has costs. There are a variety of ways to understand what those costs are. You can look at the cost of the new equipment and add in installation. There also may be some business disruption costs because you have to assume some decline in productivity while the new system or process gets up and running. There are training costs to learn how to use the new technology and there might be ongoing data collection and analytics costs and so on. Don’t forget that if you invest in this technology it might mean that you lose the opportunity to invest elsewhere in your business. And of course somewhere in the process you need to determine what success would look like to you and then consider your probabilities of attaining success. Hand in hand with that analysis you also have to look at the upsides. What new opportunities might come your way as a result of the investment? Can you retain current customers? Can you gain new customers? Can you expand your capacity? Can you develop new product lines? Can you reduce input costs such as energy or water? What might happen if you don’t invest? Can you stay competitive? What is the time horizon for your business? 6. Selecting your supplier or vendor is always important. When you buy a car price is always important but most of us look for information on how other owners have fared with that model. We might talk with our neighbors or relatives or check the internet and other sources for information. We might shop around a bit and look at alternatives. We always look at service. Do they have a good track record? Do they have the parts? Do they have the knowledge and mechanics? Does the shop have long waiting lists for appointments? How far are they away from my home? We have to go through the same process when selecting a provider for a new technology. Your new technology is going to require modifications it will break down and it will be upgraded. Can your provider give you that service? Do they have the parts and the expertise? Can they train your staff? What is their track record? Having the right supplier makes implementation easier. 7. Implement. Implementation might be one of the hardest things to do. It often means operational disruption and it is hard to turn back. It can sometimes mean running in parallel streams. For example: implementing a mechanized harvester might mean using the machine but continuing to use a harvest crew for a certain time period because you can’t be out of product. Changing a packing line into an automated line might entail the same. Chances are the introduction of the automated line will take some time to perfect and you have orders to make so you run in parallel. This is also where any asynchronies will show up i.e. where one part of your process might outstrip another unexpectedly. Training is critical – how do you use the equipment and what do you do about people issues? Do you have the talent to run more sophisticated equipment? How about sanitation challenges and food safety issues? Does the technology change the product? Are you communicating with your customers? 8. Assess and fine tune. Nobody gets it exactly right the first time. Part of defining success is choosing the appropriate measurements to assess that progress. You might need outside expertise to assist. Choose vendors that can help. Assessment can be both operational (workflow labor product quality) and financial. Are you achieving the efficiencies you sought? ,Businesses must identify issues embrace change adopt technology and continuously improve operations to remain competitive.,(BusinessTransformationthroughTechnology)(OperationalEfficiencyOptimization)(TechnologyAcquisitionImplementation)
