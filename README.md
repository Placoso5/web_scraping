STEPS FOR RUNNING THE WHOLE PROCESS:
-Run data_scraping.ipynb. This will create a new folder containing scraped_data.csv.
-Move scraped_data.csv to the same folder as Geminy API Analysis.py
-Also in that folder create a .txt document called "Geminy API Key" containing only your key.
-Run Geminy API Analysis.py, thus creating the end file analysis_summary.csv containing all of the obtained information.
